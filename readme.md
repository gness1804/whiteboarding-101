##Whiteboarding 101

Welcome to Whiteboarding 101! This session is meant to serve as an introduction to whiteboarding for Mod 1 and 2 students and as practice for Mods 3 and 4. We will work on two problems together and then split into groups to work on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) problems. If you're not familiar with CodeWars, now is a good time to create an account!

This repo has two branches aside from master: `beginning-without-solutions` and `end-with-solutions`. You'll want to clone down the repo and, run `git fetch`, and then checkout the `beginning-without-solutions` branch. Once you think you have solved the problem, you can check your answers in the `end-with-solutions` branch.

*Some tips on whiteboarding (we will go over these together):*

* The process is more important than the product. Interviewers are generally testing more how you think through problems and respond to mistakes than what your final answer is.
* Communication is king! Make the whiteboarding a dialogue between you and the interviewer(s). Convey what you are thinking, ask questions when needed, and spell out every step that you took and why you took it.
* It's ok to pseudo-code and take a few moments to consider the problem before diving in. Again, they are chiefly testing your thought process and communication skills (though of course accuracy and speed are also important).
